Auto Tester application

dev dependency (needed for building this project): PCAN package libraries and headers.
run dependency (needed for runningt this application): PCAN package driver and shared libraries, actually only libpcanbasic.so.

Usually they are not supposed to be placed together with the source files of this application as it is confusing to do so and not a good practice for project source control!
It is for backup and convenience to place these libraries together with source files, in a separate folder.

They are supposed to copied to standard library path /usr/lib and standard header path /usr/include under system rootfs when being used to compile this project natively.
They are supposed to copied to standard library path usr/lib and standard header path usr/include under the path specified by "--sysroot=..." in Makefile when being used to compile this project crossly.
It also works to keep them in where they are now and specify searching path in Makefile (option "-I" for CFLAGS and option "-L" for LDFLAGS) when being used in compiling this project either natively or crossly.
